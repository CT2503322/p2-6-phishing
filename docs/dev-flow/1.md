# Development Flow

## Enron Dataset Exploration

Initially, we explored the Enron dataset to understand the structure and content available for our assignment. 

## Data Cleaning and Processing Decision

We realized we could perform the cleaning process from the raw data, which would give us more marks for our assignment by demonstrating deeper understanding and handling of unstructured data.

## Downloading Raw Email Data

We downloaded all the Enron data in raw .eml files. However, these files do not end in the .eml extension.

## Email Parsing and Field Extraction

We focused on extracting important fields that are included in every email, such as:
- Message-ID
- Date
- From
- To
- Cc / Bcc
- Subject
- Mime-Version
- Content-Type
- Content-Transfer-Encoding
- Body (plain text/HTML content)
- Attachments

## Successful Parsing Results

After successfully parsing the emails, we were happy with the results.
